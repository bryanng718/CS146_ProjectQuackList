            <p>Quaklist is a simple music queue designed to be used at pierce dining hall.</p>
            <p>Simply upload a song and wait for it to be played. You can see which song is next by looking at the queue. You can vote on which song you like most to put it higher in the queue.</p>
            <p>This project is still a work in progress. Only the basic html and css have been implemented so far, we intend for the website to be fully functional by December 3, 2019.</p>
